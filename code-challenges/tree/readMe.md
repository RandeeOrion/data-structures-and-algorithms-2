## Challenge
    
Make it work and get a job. That is always the challenge. 
    
## Approach & Efficiency
    
I took the approach of desperation and praying to the code godess for help. 
    
## API
**Binary Tree**
preOrder() 

postOrder() 

inOrder() 

**Binary Search Tree**
add(val)

contains(val)

    
## Testing
    
Run test through 'npm test' from the root folder of tree.
